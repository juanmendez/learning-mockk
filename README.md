# learning-mockk

Mockk is a similar unit test library such as Mockito.
One of the great advantages of this library is the language in which it was created was Kotlin.

You will find it has ways to condense a lot of boiler plate to stub, and also to verify compared to Mockito.

There are certain advantages of testing coroutines better than Mockito, yet I have used it successfully to test coroutines in the past.

There were certain features which I haven't tested and I am awared of such as mocking top level functions, mocking methods with varargs.
I enjoy playing around, but also like to write notes of the things I see, so in the future I am awared of the potential in new software.
I highly recommend Mockk, it is really fun to test with.
